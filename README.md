# Fourier Neural Operator Implementation

This repository contains a project developed for a Guided Individual Study. The project focuses on implementing a Fourier Neural Operator, combining concepts from Fourier analysis and neural networks based on [Kovachki et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08481).

## Project Structure

- **data**: Directory containing data files for training and evaluation.
  - **dummyInitial_0.npy** to **dummyInitial_9.npy**: Dummy initial data files.
  - **dummyTarget_0.npy** to **dummyTarget_9.npy**: Corresponding dummy target data files.
- **evaluation.py**: Script for evaluating model performance.
- **generate.py**: Script for generating dummy data.
- **main.py**: Main script for model training and testing.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **script.py**: Additional script for project functionalities.

## Purpose

This project aims to explore the application of Fourier analysis in combination with neural networks, specifically Fourier Neural Operators. It serves as a guided individual study, delving into the intersection of signal processing and deep learning.
